# Introduction to Docker Platform

Docker is an open-source platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using container technology.

## What is Docker?
Docker provides tools and a runtime environment to build, ship, and run containers. It simplifies the process of packaging applications and their dependencies into a single, portable unit.

## Key Components
- **Docker Engine:** The core service for running and managing containers
- **Docker Images:** Read-only templates used to create containers
- **Docker Containers:** Running instances of Docker images
- **Docker Hub:** A cloud-based registry for sharing Docker images

## Benefits of Docker
- Consistent environments across development, testing, and production
- Simplified application deployment
- Efficient use of system resources

## Common Use Cases
- Microservices architecture
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- Application isolation and sandboxing
