# Container Demo 01

## 1. Pull an image from Docker Hub

To download the `mahendrshinde/cowsay` image from Docker Hub, use:
```sh
docker pull mahendrshinde/cowsay
```
This command fetches the image and stores it locally so you can run containers from it.

---

## 2. Run the container in default (terminal) mode, name it `t1`

```sh
docker run --name t1 mahendrshinde/cowsay
```
This command starts a new container named `t1` from the `mahendrshinde/cowsay` image. By default, it runs in the terminal and shows the output.

---

## 3. Run another instance with name `t2` (same configuration)

```sh
docker run --name t2 mahendrshinde/cowsay
```
This starts a second container named `t2` using the same image and configuration.

---

## 4. List the running containers

```sh
docker ps
```
This command displays all currently running containers.

---

## 5. List stopped containers

```sh
docker ps -a
```
Adding the `-a` flag shows all containers, including those that have stopped.

---

## 6. Check container logs

To view the logs for a specific container (e.g., `t1`):
```sh
docker logs t1
```
This shows the output generated by the container.

---

## 7. Delete containers

To remove the containers `t1` and `t2`:
```sh
docker rm t1 t2
```
