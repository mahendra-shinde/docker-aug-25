# Containers vs Virtual Machines

Both containers and virtual machines (VMs) are used to create isolated environments for running applications, but they differ in architecture and use cases.

## Virtual Machines
- Emulate entire hardware systems
- Each VM runs its own operating system (OS)
- Heavier resource usage (CPU, memory, storage)
- Slower startup times

## Containers
- Share the host OS kernel
- Run as isolated processes in user space
- Lightweight and efficient
- Fast startup times

| Feature           | Virtual Machine         | Container              |
|-------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| OS Isolation      | Full (separate OS)     | Partial (shared kernel)|
| Resource Usage    | High                   | Low                    |
| Startup Time      | Minutes                | Seconds                |
| Portability       | Limited                | High                   |

## When to Use Which?
- **VMs:** When you need full OS isolation or to run different OS types
- **Containers:** When you need fast, efficient, and portable application environments
