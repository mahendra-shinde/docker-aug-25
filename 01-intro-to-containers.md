# Introduction to Containers

Containers are a lightweight form of virtualization that allow you to package and run applications and their dependencies in isolated environments. Unlike traditional virtual machines, containers share the host system's operating system kernel but run in separate user spaces.

## Key Concepts
- **Isolation:** Each container runs independently, ensuring that applications do not interfere with each other.
- **Portability:** Containers can run consistently across different environments, from a developer's laptop to production servers.
- **Efficiency:** Containers are lightweight and start quickly, using fewer resources than virtual machines.

## Why Use Containers?
- Simplified deployment and scaling
- Consistent environments for development, testing, and production
- Easier management of application dependencies

## Popular Container Technologies
- Docker
- Podman
- Kubernetes (for orchestration)

In the next module, we'll compare containers with virtual machines.
